		<p>What is poverty? Poverty generally occurs when the income available to an individual
		or household does not meet their needs. This limits their ability to participate in society.
		 Poverty is social issue born from greed of our actions.    
		People living in poverty struggle to meet their basic needs, including access to food, 
		clothing, health care, education, housing and security. People experiencing poverty may also lack social,
		 economic income or resources.</p>
