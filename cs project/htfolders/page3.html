	<h1>What causes  Poverty?</h1>
	<body>

	<h2 id="cause1">Rise of living cost</h2>
	<img id="health" src="../images/rise.jpg" height="350" width="600";>
	<p>An additional increase in housing, health care, and other necessities can increase the chances of poverty. It is becasue of the inability to buy
	those things due to the lack of pay or that they are unemployed.</p> 	


	<h2 id="cause2">Low paying job</h2>
	<img id="health" src="../images/low.jpg" height="350" width="600";>
	<p>These jobs are very diverse,it ranging from the catering, cleaning, to transportation like uber or grab. despite being different,
	they have a common similarity, which is the "Pay by hour". These jobs require tips to live off or profit.</p>

	<h2 id="cause3">Social Inequality</h2>
	<img id="health" src="../images/inequality.jpg" height="350" width="600";>
	<p>The reason why social inequality is a cause of poverty is because the rich have many opportunities, resources, access to health care,
	desirable housing, and good education. Poor families on the other hand, have few opportunities,resources, and access to education to actually change their lives.</p>
